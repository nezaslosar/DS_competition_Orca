This is the final branch, we don't change it except journals. Editing is made in branch (/develop).


## Our project - Automated customer email classification (In516ht with Zavarovalnica Triglav) ##

Responding to customer emails is an important part of any service. Often emails must first be assigned to a category and sometimes even subcategories before we can determine who should respond and how. Given a data set of thousands of categorized emails, can you use modern NLP approaches and machine learning to categorize these emails automatically? Which approach gives the best results, how good are the automated predictions, and are some categories more difficult to identify than others? Answering these and other similar questions is the main goal of this project.

Keywords: natural language processing, email categorization, customer support, supervised learning
