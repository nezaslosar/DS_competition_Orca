## Our project - Automated customer email classification (In516ht with Zavarovalnica Triglav) ##

Responding to customer emails is an important part of any service. Often emails must first be assigned to a category and sometimes even subcategories before we can determine who should respond and how. Given a data set of thousands of categorized emails, can you use modern NLP approaches and machine learning to categorize these emails automatically? Which approach gives the best results, how good are the automated predictions, and are some categories more difficult to identify than others? Answering these and other similar questions is the main goal of this project.

Keywords: natural language processing, email categorization, customer support, supervised learning

### Way to the goal ###

Find criterias in literature, analysis with R, develope codes in Python and Orange. Voila!

## Folder structure ##

There are several subfolders in the repository:

* the source folder (`/src`), with subfolders: članki and codes,
* the interim report folder (`/interim_report`),
* the final report folder (`/final_report`),
* and the presentation folder (`/presentation`).

### The source folder ###

All our source codes and articles should go into this folder. How you structure things (e.g. via subfolders) inside there is completely up to you.

### The interim report folder ###

With draft of it.

### The final report folder ###

Here we will prepare draft and dan pull it to master.

### The presentation folder ###

Put the draft document containing your final presentation into this folder.
